The chllenge: LawFirm IT-Security Check - Application
We would like to develop an application, that is able to detect as many IT-Security issues in a lawfirm´s IT – infrastructure as possible. 
It should be able to analyze the network, clients etc. more or less automatically to deliver a speaking report on the current status of the lawfirms IT-Security.
